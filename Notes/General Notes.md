  - side effects may be less severe than surgery/radiation b/c smaller incision for cryoprobe
  - target specific tissues
  - efficacy still being analyzed
- hormone therapy
  - 2 groups
    - block hormone production
    - interfere with hormone effects

  - endoscope inserted
    - special form called laser-induced interstitial thermotherapy (LITT) that is used like hyperthermia
    - photodynamic therapy - photosensitizer activated by laser, makes skin/eyes sensitive
  - more precise than scalpels, do less damage, shorter ops/recovery, less infection risk
  - may not be as effective
- precision medicine - (drugs that target specific mutations that you have are known as targeted therapy, but targeted therapy is a big part of precision medicine)
  - target the specific mutations that you have
  - pace of research in this field has sped up in recent years
  - two main types
    - small-molecule drugs
    - monoclonal antibodies
      - attach to specific targets on cancer cells
      - some mark for immune system destruction
      - others carry stop growth - usually cells rely on signals that cause division, cancer cells have these always on, therapies target these proteins
      - stop angiogenesis - angiogenesis inhibitors
      - cause self-destruction
      - others attach and cause the cells to take up cell-killing substances
      - hormone therapies that prevent the hormones from acting on your specific cells
    - need a biopsy
    - cancer cells can become resistant, drugs for targets are hard to develop
  - currently only available for people who have a specific genetic mutation

  - side effect - graft-vs-host disease

### Benign brain tumor

- definition: `group of similar cells that do not follow normal cell division and growth patterns and develop into a mass of cells that microscopically do not have the characteristic appearance of a cancer`
- detection by CT or MRI
- grow slowly, usually do not metastasize
- usuallly removable and do not reoccur
- unknown risk factors
- life-threatening due to brain tissue compression - "benign" misleading
- 85-90% of primary CNS tumors are in the brain for adults
- 1-2% of CNS tumors are in the spinal cord for children
- types
  - meningioma - membranes covering brain/spinal cord
  - schwannoma aka acoustic neuroma - Schwann cells

  - secondary tumors common in long term survivors (esp. for radiation)
  - no staging system for most childhood brain tumors

### [The cancer genome](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature07943)

- background
  - all cancers arise from mutations
  - 1/8 of global deaths are from cancer
- history
  - `specific and recurrent genomic abnormalities ... are associated with particular cancer types`
- cancer is an evolutionary process
  - Darwinian evolution among cell populations
  - two main processes
    - continuous acquisition of mutations from random events
    - natural selection - kills cells with bad mutations, selects for mutations that allow for more proliferation
  - most that are selected for growth are benign, occasionally become cancerous
- types of mutations
  - mutations happen throughout lifetime
  - passenger mutations don't do anything
  - driver mutations cause clonal expansion
  - resistance to chemotherapy usually develops before exposure to chemo, subsequent treatment selects for resistance
  - gene amplification - copy number can advance to hundreds
  - viruses can also contribute new DNA sources to the genome
    - human papilloma virus, Epstein Barr virus, hepatitis B virus, human T lymphotropic virus 1 and human herpes virus 8
  - epigenetic changes
    - altered chromatin structure/gene expression
    - changes in methylation status of some cytosine residues
    - also subject to Darwinian selection as long as long as:
      - there is epigenetic variation in the population of competing cells
      - epigenetic variation can be passed on
      - corresponding phenotypes for selection pressures to act on
  - mitochondrial genome (~17kb also present)
    - somatic mutations in mitochondrial genomes also reported in many cancers
- acquisition of mutations
  - mechanisms
    - mutagens - internal/external origins
    - some damage unrepaired, DNA replication has base error rate
    - rates relatively unknown - different types of mutations/different tissue types likely have different rates
  - timing
    - some occur before cancer phenotypes
    - others after - debate over whether somatic mutation rate is higher after neoplastic change
    - some types of cancers definitely have higher rates - "mutator phenotype"
    - others argue this is not required for development of some cancers
    - in either case - more mutations means there is sequence diversity for selection
    - sometimes there will be a large sudden change ("crisis") - might be due to shortening of telomeres, cell has to reorganize genome
  - represent archaeological record of mutational processes
- driver/passenger mutations
  - driver - growth advantage, occur in "cancer genes"
  - passenger - no growth advantage, happen to be present
  - some genes may actually confer negative selection - few have been detected so far
  - how to distinguish
    - past approach - sequence small regions, use certain signatures of driver mutations
      - driver - usually clustered around cancer genes
      - passenger - usually randomly distributed
    - WGS - many more passengers than drivers
      - some mutational pathways may be focused on specific regions of the genome and generate clusters of passenger mutations
      - be extra careful in using these signatures
  - count - some estimates of about 5-6 drivers required for cancer in certain subtypes - other estimates higher - recurrence mutations (resist treatment) - some seem to predate treatment, transform from passengers to drivers after treatment is started
- known cancer genes (**aka \*\*repertoire\*\***)
  - estimated 350/22K genes shown to have recurrent somatic mutations
  - about 10% of these are also found in germ line mutations
  - estimated 2000 total cancer genes
  - some found in more than 1 type of cancer, others specialized
    - common ones: TP53, KRAS
  - dominance
    - about 90% of mutated genes are dominant - usually results in protein encoding
      - more constrained mutation types - missense, insertions/deletions, gene amplification
      - most from genomic rearrangement - fusion genes when they are positioned together, position cancer gene next to other regulatory elements
    - 10% are recessive - protein stops being made, tumor suppressor genes
      - diverse mutation types - SNP's, deletions
  - some protein families/signalling families especially frequently mutated
  - some cancers classified/treated by mutation type - opportunities for targeted therapies
- Systematic sequencing of cancer genomes
  - human genome project - several studies looking at point mutations for specific exons
  - tradeoff between studying many genes for a specific cancer type and a few genes for many cancer types
  - ex. IDH1 (part of Krebs cycle) found to be mutated in glioma
  - important insights
    - most point mutations are passengers (even in exons)
    - `drivers appear to be distributed across a large number of genes, each of which is mutated infrequently, suggesting that the repertoire of somatically mutated human cancer genes is much larger than the ∼350 currently catalogued`
    - certain patterns of mutations in certain cancer subtypes
    - effects of chemo revealed
      - certain drugs have a distinctive signature in the pattern of mutations that they select for
    - rearrangements harder to classify
- future
  - sequence all bases for a sample from cancer, compare with reference genome
  - challenges
    - require deep coverage
    - need to distinguish from baseline mutations
      - some rare variants relatively common but still unknown
    - need probably around 100B bp from a single genome to identify somatic mutations
  - ICGC - working on it

### [The molecular landscape of glioma in patients with Neurofibromatosis 1](https://www-nature-com.revproxy.brown.edu/articles/s41591-018-0263-8)

- Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) - tumor predisposition syndrome
  - glioma is a prevalent tumor - can be low to high grade

  - [interesting data chart](https://media.springernature.com/m685/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41591-018-0263-8/MediaObjects/41591_2018_263_Fig1_HTML.png?as=webp)
  - WES done on blood/glioma samples for those available
  - inferred germline status of NF1 mutations from tumor-only samples using computational approach
  - 91% patients had germline mutations that inactivated NF1 gene
    - distribution of mutations not correlated with protein domains, age, or tumor grade
    - mutations increased in the glioma DNA - patients lost both functioning versions of the allele
    - somatic mutations also found in 7/56 patients where there was a germline mutation on one allele and a somatic mutation on the other - **check to see if both alleles have the mutation**
  - **`The application of a stringent somatic **mutation**-calling algorithm to the cohort of NF1-glioma resulted in <x number of mutations>`**
    - **higher grades and ages had higher mutational burden**
    - **`GISTIC2.0?`**
    - IDH was wildtype in all gliomas in this study
    - **classified the number of mutational clones for age and grade**
  - **compared certain mutation frequencies to another type of glioma** - sporadic gliomas
  - **figured out which factors were predictors of certain mutations/correlations**
  - **identified specifically targeted biological pathways and frequency in different grades of gliomas**

    - `transcriptomic-based analysis with five different CD8+ T cell-specific gene expression signatures` - show the differential expression of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells
      - conducted immunostaining to verify
    - **granzyme B (GZMB)** - the key cytolytic effector that is upregulated on CD8+ T cell activation, and productive responses to immunotherapies
  - methylation data
    - `Recent data showed that aberrant DNA methylation of genes expressed by immune cells regulates the extent of immune infiltration in solid tumors`
    - `profiled 11 of the low-grade NF1-gliomas previously analyzed by RNAseq with the 850K Epic Methylation platform`
    - **figured out which genes were hypermethylated in high vs. low immune NF1-gliomas**
  - neoantigens
    - `NF1-gliomas profiled with matched germline/tumor WES and tumor RNAseq for HLA typing and tumor neoantigen identification`
    - `performed a homogenous, proximity-based assay that measures the affinity kinetics of mutant neoantigens and corresponding wild-type peptides for binding to their restricted HLA class I allele` - **figure out specific neoantigens**
  - comparison to other types of gliomas using TCGA
    - `compared the epigenetic features through an integrative analysis of DNA methylation profiles of NF1-gliomas and the TCGA pan-glioma data set`
    - `performed a supervised classification of NF1-gliomas using a nearest neighbor classifier trained on sporadic gliomas`
    - `unsupervised clustering, merging sporadic TCGA gliomas and NF1-gliomas`
    - `used mathematical methods based on a multiple linear regression model to deconvolute mutation signatures that in other cancer types have been associated with distinct underlying mutational processes`
    - looked at patterns of driver mutations/CNV's in related group of gliomas
    - looked at master regulator patterns using gene regulatory network (computational technique) - clustered based on MR patterns
      - found correlation with certain type of mutation between the two clustered groups
    - looked at what the master regulators did specifically - in this case had chromatin/transcription regulation goals in the mutant gliomas
- Discussion
  - surgical resection generally not recommended due to `inaccessible brain tumor location, the relatively benign behavior of brain lesions, the comorbidities, and the neurological deterioration associated with surgical intervention`
  -

- liquid biopsy - `A test done on a sample of blood to look for cancer cells from a tumor that are circulating in the blood or for pieces of DNA from tumor cells that are in the blood. A liquid biopsy may be used to help find cancer at an early stage. It may also be used to help plan treatment or to find out how well treatment is working or if cancer has come back. Being able to take multiple samples of blood over time may also help doctors understand what kind of molecular changes are taking place in a tumor.`

  - can be useful for genetic fingerprinting when the number of repeats is variable in populations
- [unequal crossing over](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unequal_crossing_over)
  - during meiosis crossing over, the sequences are not paired properly so one chromosome produced has duplicates of a gene while the other has a deletion
  - this can happen more often in regions with many repeats because the misalignment happens more easily when there is a lot of similarity in the region
  - exchanges a lot of DNA in one event

- [RNA-seq video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlf6wYJrwKY)
  - prepare sequencing library
    - isolate rna
    - break into RNA fragments
    - convert into cDNA - more stable
    - add adaptors to allow sequencing machine to recognize fratments, sequence different samples at the same time (different samples can use the same adaptors)
  - filter out garbage reads
    - low quality base calls OR
    - artifacts of chemistry (ex. 2 adaptor sequences binded)
  - measure relative expression based on whether the data is bulk or single cell
- allele fraction
  - allele drift

- gene amplification - copy number can advance to hundreds
- look into things from 6/14 conference
- churn rate - turnover rate of a population (insurance, how many people will switch plans)
