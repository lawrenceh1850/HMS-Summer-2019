### Ways to treat cancer

- surgery - used for people with one solid, localized lump
  - regular cutting
  - cryosurgery
  - lasers
  - hyperthermia - RF ablation, mostly experimental right now
  - photodynamic therapy - light-responsive drugs that
- radiation therapy
  - internal vs. external
  - local vs. systemic
  - lifetime healthy limits
- chemotherapy
  - neoadjuvant - before surgery, make surgery more likely to succeed
  - adjuvant - after surgery to maximize probability of success
  - kills fast growing cells such as mouth/intestinal lining, hair
  - causes a lot of fatigue
  - happens in cycles with rest in between
  - usually have a permanent port/catheter installed, can have a pump attached to the port/catheter also
- cryosurgery
  - external tumors using cotton swab/spray of cold liquid
  - internal - cryoprobe guided with ultrasound or MRI
  - used for skin cancers/bone tumors
  - small areas only
  - side effects may be less severe than surgery/radiation b/c smaller incision for cryoprobe
  - target specific tissues
  - efficacy still being analyzed
- hormone therapy
  - 2 groups
    - block hormone production
    - interfere with hormone effects
  - usually used with other treatments - neoadjuvant/adjuvant split
  - used for prostate/breast cancers that rely on hormones to grow
  - pills/injection/surgery to remove hormone producing organs
  - prostate - PSA tests
  - breast - regular checkups
- hyperthermia
  - high temps can kill/damage cancer without harming normal tissues
  - still under study
  - usually used with other forms (radiation/chemo)
  - local - small area
  - regional - external or perfusion techniques
  - whole body hyperthermia - raise entire body temperature
- immunotherapy - see specific note file on this
- laser
  - usually used for superficial cancers (body surface or lining of internal organs)
  - relieve symptoms (decrease tumor size, get rid of polyps), seal nerve endings
  - endoscope inserted
    - special form called laser-induced interstitial thermotherapy (LITT) that is used like hyperthermia
    - photodynamic therapy - photosensitizer activated by laser, makes skin/eyes sensitive
  - more precise than scalpels, do less damage, shorter ops/recovery, less infection risk
  - may not be as effective
- precision medicine - (drugs that target specific mutations that you have are known as targeted therapy, but targeted therapy is a big part of precision medicine)
  - target the specific mutations that you have
  - pace of research in this field has sped up in recent years
  - two main types
    - small-molecule drugs
    - monoclonal antibodies
      - attach to specific targets on cancer cells
      - some mark for immune system destruction
      - others carry stop growth - usually cells rely on signals that cause division, cancer cells have these always on, therapies target these proteins
      - stop angiogenesis - angiogenesis inhibitors
      - cause self-destruction
      - others attach and cause the cells to take up cell-killing substances
      - hormone therapies that prevent the hormones from acting on your specific cells
    - need a biopsy
    - cancer cells can become resistant, drugs for targets are hard to develop
  - currently only available for people who have a specific genetic mutation
  - need a biopsy, get DNA sequencing done
  - find mutations, put in shared databases, develop drugs that can target a specific mutation
- stem cell transplants
  - replace blood-forming stem cells that are destroyed by chemo or radiation
  - receive healthy stem cells from IV, travel to bone marrow and replace destroyed cells
    - stem cells from bone marrow, blodstream, umbilical cord
    - autologous, allogeneic, syngeneic transplants
    - need match between donor and recipient
  - doesn't affect cancer directly except for **multiple myeloma** and some types of leukemia where there is the graft-versus-tumor effect
  - side effect - graft-vs-host disease

### Benign brain tumor
