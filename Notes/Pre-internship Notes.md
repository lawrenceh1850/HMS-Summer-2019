### Ways to treat cancer
- surgery - used for people with one solid, localized lump
  - regular cutting
  - cryosurgery
  - lasers
  - hyperthermia - RF ablation, mostly experimental right now
  - photodynamic therapy - light-responsive drugs that 
- radiation therapy
  - internal vs. external
  - local vs. systemic
  - lifetime healthy limits
- chemotherapy
  - neoadjuvant - before surgery
  - adjuvant - after surgery to maximize probability of success
  - kills fast growing cells such as mouth/intestinal lining, hair
  - causes a lot of fatigue
  - happens in cycles with rest in between
  - usually have a permanent port/catheter installed, can have a pump attached to the port/catheter also
- cryosurgery
  - external tumors using cotton swab/spray of cold liquid
  - internal - cryoprobe guided with ultrasound or MRI
  - used for skin cancers/bone tumors
  - small areas only
  - side effects may be less severe than surgery/radiation b/c smaller incision for cryoprobe
  - target specific tissues
  - efficacy still being analyzed
- hormone therapy
  - 2 groups
    - block hormone production
    - interfere with hormone effects
  - usually used with other treatments - neoadjuvant/adjuvant split
  - used for prostate/breast cancers that rely on hormones to grow
  - pills/injection/surgery to remove hormone producing organs
  - prostate - PSA tests
  - breast - regular checkups
- hyperthermia
  - high temps can kill/damage cancer without harming normal tissues
  - still under study
  - usually used with other forms (radiation/chemo)
  - local - small area
  - regional - external or perfusion techniques
  - whole body hyperthermia - raise entire body temperature
- immunotherapy
  - type of biological therapy because cancer cells can hide from immune system
  - direct attack type
    - checkpoint inhibitors - release "brakes" that keep T cells from killing cancer cells, target cancer cell ability to avoid immune system attack
    - adoptive cell transfer - take out the T cells from the tumor that have been the most responsive to tumor, grow them and then inject back in
      - **CAR-T???** 
    - monoclonal antibodies - aka therapeutic antibodies
      - grown in the lab, designed to attach to specific targets found in the lab
      - some mark cancer cells so they can be seen by immune system
      - others do not cause response - **targeted therapy**
        - small-molecule drugs
        - monoclonal antibodies
          - attach to specific targets on cancer cells
          - some mark for immune system destruction
          - others carry stop growth - usually cells rely on signals that cause division, cancer cells have these always on, therapies target these proteins
          - stop angiogenesis - angiogenesis inhibitors
          - cause self-destruction
          - others attach and cause the cells to take up cell-killing substances
          - hormone therapies that prevent the hormones from acting on your specific cells
        - need a biopsy
        - cancer cells can become resistant, drugs for targets are hard to develop
    - treatment vaccines - boost immune response to cancer cells, different from preventative vaccines
  - immune system stimulation
    - cytokines - proteins that modulate normal/anti-cancer immune response, **interferons/interleukins**
    - BCG - Bacillus Calmette-Guerin, for bladder cancer, weakened tuberculosis bacteria, inserted into bladder and causes immune response against cancer cells, being studied for other types of cancer
  - not as common, still being studied
  - some are given as cycles
  - oral, IV, topical, intravesical (directly into bladder)
- laser
  - usually used for superficial cancers (body surface or lining of internal organs)
  - relieve symptoms (decrease tumor size, get rid of polyps), seal nerve endings
  - endoscope inserted
    - special form called laser-induced interstitial thermotherapy (LITT) that is used like hyperthermia
    - photodynamic therapy - photosensitizer activated by laser, makes skin/eyes sensitive
  - more precise than scalpels, do less damage, shorter ops/recovery, less infection risk
  - may not be as effective
- precision medicine
  - target the specific mutations that you have
  - pace of research in this field has sped up in recent years
  - targeted therapies
  - currently only available for people who have a specific genetic mutation
  - need a biopsy, get DNA sequencing done
  - find mutations, put in shared databases, develop drugs that can target a specific mutation
- stem cell transplants
  - replace blood-forming stem cells that are destroyed by chemo or radiation
  - receive healthy stem cells from IV, travel to bone marrow and replace destroyed cells
    - stem cells from bone marrow, blodstream, umbilical cord
    - autologous, allogeneic, syngeneic transplants
    - need match between donor and recipient
  - doesn't affect cancer directly except for **multiple myeloma** and some types of leukemia where there is the graft-versus-tumor effect
  - side effect - graft-vs-host disease

### Benign brain tumor

- definition: `group of similar cells that do not follow normal cell division and growth patterns and develop into a mass of cells that microscopically do not have the characteristic appearance of a cancer`
- detection by CT or MRI
- grow slowly, usually do not metastasize
- usuallly removable and do not reoccur
- unknown risk factors
- life-threatening due to brain tissue compression - "benign" misleading
- types

  - MRI - better soft-tissue resolution, preferred for certain conditions
  - posttherapy imaging - SPECT/PET
  - biopsy - usually required to confirm diagnosis
    - rare that clinical/radiologic signs clearly indicate benign tumor
    - CT/MRI guided placement
- specific mutations that might cause - IDH, 1p19q
- different WHO grades developed to classify seriousness
- treatment options
  - surgery
  - radiation therapy

## Notes that stick out
---
- [not a lot of data on benign tumor survival rate](file:///home/lhuang21/Documents/Misc/Harvard/Readings/Benign%20Brain%20Tumor%20Symptoms,%20Signs%20&%20Types.htm)
- seizures can start happening months to years before diagnosis of a slow growing brain tumor
- other conditions can have similar presentations as brain tumors abscesses, arteriovenous malformations, and infarctions
- CT vs. MRI diagnosis
- most patients with CNS tumors usually don't live long enough to develop metastatic disease
