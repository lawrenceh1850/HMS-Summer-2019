### Understanding Tumor Dynamics and Heterogeneity

by Gad Getz

- tumor evolution and heterogeneity from sequencing data
- seeing tumor mutation events and subpopulation cells as an evolutionary process
- Bayesian clustering algorithm
- use subclone events to find dynamics
  - figure order of mutation events
- white blood count surrogate of burden of disease (for CLL)
- tools for discovering drivers
  - GISTIC - copy numbers
  - MutSig - mutations
  - NetSig
  - CLUMPS/EMPRINT
- tumorportal.org
- phylogicNDT tool
- scRNA-seq data to study tumor/microenvironment

### Senescence and Cancer

by Stephen Elledge

- GATA4 overexpressing tumor cells have more T cell infiltration
- SASP
- Dox

### Predicting response from single cell transcriptomics

**by Meromit Singer**

- single cell RNA seq
  - characterization - cluster cells based on expressed characterizations
- see what happens following intervention to the clusters
  - do clusters change size/expression/interactions (one population has ligands and one population has receptors)
- need correct design of statistical tests
- objective: move from characterization to functional studies
- COMET - tool that allows you to find marker genes that will help you
  - web UI
  - Python API
- RNA seq data can be sparse
