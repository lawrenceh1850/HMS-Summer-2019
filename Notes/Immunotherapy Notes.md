- immunotherapy

  - type of biological therapy because cancer cells can hide from immune system
  - direct attack type

    - checkpoint inhibitors - release "brakes" that keep T cells from killing cancer cells, target cancer cell ability to avoid immune system attack
    - adoptive cell transfer - take out the T cells from the tumor that have been the most responsive to tumor, grow them and then inject back in

      - TIL's (tumor infiltrating lymphocytes) - penetrate tumor environment
      - TCR's (T-cell receptor) - naturally occurring receptors that can recognize antigens inside tumor cells
      - **[CAR T-cell](https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/treatment/research/car-t-cells)** - treatment that has attracted a lot of attention recently

        - small clinical trials for advanced blood cancers have caused remarkable responses (lymphomas/leukemias)
        - FDA approved for children with acute lympoblastic leukemia (ALL) and adults with advanced lymphomas
        - still early days - not sure if treatment will extend to solid tumors
        - T cells - draw blood from patients, separate out T cells, using a disarmed virus engineer the T cells to produce receptors called chimeric antigen receptors (CARs)
        - receptors recognize an antigen on tumor surface - grow a ton of these new T cells in the laboratory, the most advanced therapies target a B cell antigen called CD19
        - infuse CAR T cells into the patient - preceded by a lymphodepleting chemotherapy regimen
        - CAR - composed of domains of synthetic antibodies
          - advances made to the intracellular features of the engineered T cells - produce more T cells after infusion, survive longer, can be produced faster now
        - focus on use for relapsed ALL - almost no other treatment options
        - side effects
          - cytokine release syndrome (CRS) - flood of cytokines (technically what is supposed to happen), fevers/blood pressure drops, can be treated with steroids and drug with blocks IL-6 activity (tocilizumab (ActemraÂ®))
          - off target effects
            - mass die off of B cells (B cell aplasia) - normal B cells killed by CAR T cells too, receive immunoglobulin therapy to replace antibodies that were being produced by the B cells
            - cerebral edema in some limited clinical trials
        - limitations
          - antigen loss - cancer cells will stop expressing the antigen that is being targeted
            - researchers testing other antigens (CD22), co-targeting of multiple antigens at the same time
          - solid tumors - express most antigens on the inside of cells, CAR's can't reach, immune-suppressing environment of solid tumors
            - [lymphocyte transfer instead for myeloma](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3131487/)
            - some researchers looking into other targets for CAR T cells
            - [EGFRvIII for glioblastoma](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28724573)
            - ["armored" T cells that secrete cytokines to overcome tumor environment](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27068948)

    - monoclonal antibodies - aka therapeutic antibodies
      - grown in the lab, designed to attach to specific targets found in the lab
      - some mark cancer cells so they can be seen by immune system
      - others do not cause response - considered **targeted therapy** rather than immunotherapy
    - treatment vaccines - boost immune response to cancer cells, different from preventative vaccines

  - immune system stimulation
    - cytokines - proteins that modulate normal/anti-cancer immune response, **interferons/interleukins**
    - BCG - Bacillus Calmette-Guerin, for bladder cancer, weakened tuberculosis bacteria, inserted into bladder and causes immune response against cancer cells, being studied for other types of cancer
  - not as common, still being studied
  - some are given as cycles
  - oral, IV, topical, intravesical (directly into bladder)
