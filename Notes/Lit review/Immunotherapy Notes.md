- immunotherapy

  - [background](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BU-V-2qSOjM)
    - heterogeneity between mutation profiles of individuals with the same disease
    - different types of mutated cell populations within the same individual
    - adjuvant - something that kickstarts the immune system, cytokines/TLR agonists/STING ligands
  - [types](https://www.esmo.org/content/download/124130/2352601/file/ESMO-Patient-Guide-on-Immunotherapy-Side-Effects.pdf)
    - passive - boost ex isting immune response, more successful so far, ex. checkpoint inhibitors
    - active - direct immune cell attack, ex. anti-cancer vaccines
  - results
    - responses to immunotherapy in trials have been moderate percentage but long-term, chemo has high percentage response but short term
  - theory
    - tumors have protein coding changes from mutations (**tumor neoantigens - only present on the cancer cells and not normal cells**)
    - tumors also have shared, overexpressed self-antigens that have been historic targets - but these are also expressed on regular cells
    - driver mutation (DNA) leads to neoantigens (proteins)
      - occurs because there are a ton of mutations in cancerous cells
    - immune system can adapt as the cancer adapts
  - future work

    - - **need more work to understand biomarkers that identify patients who will respond well to immunotherapy**
    - combined therapies
      - inhibitor + other inhibitors
      - inhibitor + immune boost
      - inhibitor + radiation
      - etc.
    - cancer genome sequencing
      - which oncogenes are drug targets
      - neoantigens (protein mutations) that can be targets
    - tummor immunoevasion score
      - which immune evasion pathways are present in a tumor

  - attack the tumor

    - checkpoint inhibitors
      - immune therapy uses receptor proteins on T cells - activate/inhibit them at certain checkpoints
        - if there weren't checkpoints then the T cells would kill healthy cells
      - release "brakes" that keep T cells from killing cancer cells
      - target cancer cell ability to avoid immune system attack
      - PD-1 and CTLA-4 receptors
        - expressed on T cells/others
        - when ligands interact with these receptors, T cells are inhibited
        - cancer cells can secrete these inhibitors
        - tumor cell expresses PD-L1 (ligand that interacts with PD-1) that blocks the T cell
      - Ipilimumab (Yervoy) CTLA-4 drug - FDA approved for malignant melanoma
      - antibody drug that blocks either PD-1 or PD-L1
    - adoptive cell transfer - take out the T cells from the tumor that have been the most responsive to tumor, grow them and then inject back in

      - TIL's (tumor infiltrating lymphocytes) - penetrate tumor environment
      - TCR's (T-cell receptor) - naturally occurring receptors that can recognize antigens inside tumor cells
      - **[CAR T-cell](https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/treatment/research/car-t-cells)** - treatment that has attracted a lot of attention recently

        - small clinical trials for advanced blood cancers have caused remarkable responses (lymphomas/leukemias)
        - FDA approved for children with acute lympoblastic leukemia (ALL) and adults with advanced lymphomas
        - still early days - not sure if treatment will extend to solid tumors
        - T cells - draw blood from patients, separate out T cells, using a disarmed virus engineer the T cells to produce receptors called chimeric antigen receptors (CARs)
        - receptors recognize an antigen on tumor surface - grow a ton of these new T cells in the laboratory, the most advanced therapies target a B cell antigen called CD19
        - infuse CAR T cells into the patient - preceded by a lymphodepleting chemotherapy regimen
        - CAR - composed of domains of synthetic antibodies
          - advances made to the intracellular features of the engineered T cells - produce more T cells after infusion, survive longer, can be produced faster now
        - focus on use for relapsed ALL - almost no other treatment options
        - side effects
          - cytokine release syndrome (CRS) - flood of cytokines (technically what is supposed to happen), fevers/blood pressure drops, can be treated with steroids and drug with blocks IL-6 activity (tocilizumab (ActemraÂ®))
          - off target effects
            - mass die off of B cells (B cell aplasia) - normal B cells killed by CAR T cells too, receive immunoglobulin therapy to replace antibodies that were being produced by the B cells
            - cerebral edema in some limited clinical trials
        - limitations
          - antigen loss - cancer cells will stop expressing the antigen that is being targeted
            - researchers testing other antigens (CD22), co-targeting of multiple antigens at the same time
          - solid tumors - express most antigens on the inside of cells, CAR's can't reach, immune-suppressing environment of solid tumors

    - monoclonal antibodies - aka therapeutic antibodies
      - grown in the lab, designed to attach to specific targets found in the lab
      - some mark cancer cells so they can be seen by immune system
      - others do not cause response - considered **targeted therapy** rather than immunotherapy
    - [treatment vaccines](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-017-08706-3) - boost immune response to cancer cells, different from preventative vaccines
      - ex. inject personalized neoantigens based on the genomes of the cancerous cells - personalized medicine
      - different delivery methods
        - conventional - make the neoantigen peptides, inject it directly
        - dendritic cell delivery - take precursors of these cells, which are APC's and then inject them
      - not all neoantigens prompt an immune response, easier to target high mutation cancers
        - algorithms to predict which neoantigens are needed
    - virus treatment

      - [oncolytic viruses](https://www.cancer.gov/news-events/cancer-currents-blog/2018/oncolytic-viruses-to-treat-cancer) - infect and reproduce in cancerous cells
        - can be natural or synthetic
        - healthy cells should be able to fight the infection, or they can be engineered to not infect healthy cells
        - believed to help release tumor antigens after killing the cells - help stimulate immune response (form of immunotherapy)
        - **[study for brain tumors found viruses can cross blood-brain barrier, make checkpoint blockade more efficient](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29298869)**
        - FDA-approved (T-VEC) oncolytic virus for melanoma - injected into tumor
          - combination therapy with pembrolizumab (Keytruda) found that this could inflame tumors (T cells go into the tumor), then allow the checkpoint inhibitors to work

  - immune system stimulation
    - cytokines - proteins that modulate normal/anti-cancer immune response, **interferons/interleukins**
      - communicate between different cell types - tell them to turn on/off
      - help fight infections
      - can be lab-synthesized
      - IL-2 in significant amounts has side effects
      - immune systems are designed to fight infection - turn off after the infection is suppressed
        - this is essentially releasing the brakes on that process
        - these have a larger effect than the current therapies because they activate T-cells all throughout the body
    - BCG - Bacillus Calmette-Guerin, for bladder cancer, weakened tuberculosis bacteria, inserted into bladder and causes immune response against cancer cells, being studied for other types of cancer, has been in use for decades
  - some are given as cycles
  - oral, IV, topical, intravesical (directly into bladder)
