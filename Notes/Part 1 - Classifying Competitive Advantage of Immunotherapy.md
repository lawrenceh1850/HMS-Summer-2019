### Potential Benign Tumor types

- [types of brain tumors](https://www.aans.org/en/Patients/Neurosurgical-Conditions-and-Treatments/Brain-Tumors)

  - classified by origin
    - primary - originate from tissues of the brain/immediate surroundings
      - glial
      - non-glial - nerves, blood vessels, glands, etc.
    - metastatic - originate elsewhere in the body and migrate to the brain, usually through bloodstream
      - considered cancer/malignant
      - 1/4 of patients with cancer will have a metastatic brain tumor
  - classified by spread
    - [benign](https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/002236.htm) = not cancerous: won't spread to other parts of the body
      - usually grows slowly, not harmful
      - `A benign tumor may grow big enough or be found near blood vessels, the brain, nerves, or organs. As a result, it can cause problems locally without spreading to another part of the body. Sometimes, these problems can be serious.`
    - [malignant](https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/002253.htm) - cancerous cells with ability to metastasize or invade locally (nearby)
      - fast, uncontrolled growth
      - do not die normally

- [from this article](https://www.cancer.gov/types/brain/hp/adult-brain-treatment-pdq#_1)
  - In pilocytic astrocytomas `(WHO grade I), tandem duplication at 7q34 leading to a fusion between KIAA1549 and BRAF is found in approximately 70% of pilocytic astrocytomas.[6-8] An activating point mutation in BRAF (V600E) is found in an additional 5% to 9% of these tumors and in general, RAF alterations occur in approximately 80% of pilocytic astrocytomas.
  - BRAF V600E mutations are observed (in about 60%) of other benign glioma variants, including pleomorphic xanthoastrocytoma and ganglioglioma, while BRAF tandem duplications are not found in these variant glioma tumors.[9-11]
