### Potential Benign Tumor types

- [from this article](https://www.cancer.gov/types/brain/hp/adult-brain-treatment-pdq#_1)
  - In pilocytic astrocytomas (WHO grade I), tandem duplication at 7q34 leading to a fusion between KIAA1549 and BRAF is found in approximately 70% of pilocytic astrocytomas.[6-8] An activating point mutation in BRAF (V600E) is found in an additional 5% to 9% of these tumors and in general, RAF alterations occur in approximately 80% of pilocytic astrocytomas.
  - BRAF V600E mutations are observed (in about 60%) of other benign glioma variants, including pleomorphic xanthoastrocytoma and ganglioglioma, while BRAF tandem duplications are not found in these variant glioma tumors.[9-11]

### Criteria for classifying current cancer by competitive advantage

- WHO Grades (TNM classification scheme dropped)
- location of tumor
- cost (?)
- survival rate
- symptoms
