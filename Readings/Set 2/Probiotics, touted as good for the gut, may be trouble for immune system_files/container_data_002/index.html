              <h2>WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS</h2>
              <p><strong>Hemorrhage:</strong> Fatal bleeding events have occurred in patients treated with IMBRUVICA<sup>®</sup>.
 Grade 3 or higher bleeding events (intracranial hemorrhage [including 
subdural hematoma], gastrointestinal bleeding, hematuria, and post 
procedural hemorrhage) have occurred in 3% of patients, with fatalities 
occurring in 0.3% of 1,124 patients exposed to IMBRUVICA<sup>®</sup> in 
clinical trials. Bleeding events of any grade, including bruising and 
petechiae, occurred in 44% of patients treated with IMBRUVICA<sup>®</sup>.</p>
              <p>The mechanism for the bleeding events is not well understood.</p>
              <p>IMBRUVICA<sup>®</sup> may increase the risk of 
hemorrhage in patients receiving antiplatelet or anticoagulant therapies
 and patients should be monitored for signs of bleeding.</p>
              <p>Consider the benefit-risk of withholding IMBRUVICA<sup>®</sup> for at least 3 to 7 days pre- and post-surgery depending upon the type of surgery and the risk of bleeding.</p>
              <p><strong>Infections:</strong> Fatal and non-fatal infections (including bacterial, viral, or fungal) have occurred with IMBRUVICA<sup>®</sup> therapy. Grade 3 or greater infections occurred in 24% of 1,124 patients exposed to IMBRUVICA<sup>®</sup> in clinical trials. Cases of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) and <em>Pneumocystis jirovecii</em> pneumonia (PJP) have occurred in patients treated with IMBRUVICA<sup>®</sup>. Consider prophylaxis according to standard of care in patients who are at increased risk for opportunistic infections.</p>
              <p>Monitor and evaluate patients for fever and infections and treat appropriately.</p>
              <p><strong>Cytopenias:</strong> Treatment-emergent Grade 3
 or 4 cytopenias including neutropenia (23%), thrombocytopenia (8%), and
 anemia (3%) based on laboratory measurements occurred in patients with 
B-cell malignancies treated with single agent IMBRUVICA<sup>®</sup>.</p>
              <p>Monitor complete blood counts monthly.</p>
              <p><strong>Cardiac Arrhythmias:</strong> Fatal and serious cardiac arrhythmias have occurred with IMBRUVICA<sup>®</sup>
 therapy. Grade 3 or greater ventricular tachyarrhythmias occurred in 
0.2% of patients, and Grade 3 or greater atrial fibrillation and atrial 
flutter occurred in 4% of 1,124 patients exposed to IMBRUVICA<sup>®</sup>
 in clinical trials. These events have occurred particularly in patients
 with cardiac risk factors, hypertension, acute infections, and a 
previous history of cardiac arrhythmias.</p>
              <p>Periodically monitor patients clinically for cardiac 
arrhythmias. Obtain an ECG for patients who develop arrhythmic symptoms 
(e.g., palpitations, lightheadedness, syncope, chest pain) or new onset 
dyspnea. Manage cardiac arrhythmias appropriately, and if it persists, 
consider the risks and benefits of IMBRUVICA<sup>®</sup> treatment and follow dose modification guidelines.</p>
              <p><strong>Hypertension:</strong> Hypertension of any grade occurred in 12% of 1,124 patients treated with IMBRUVICA<sup>®</sup>
 in clinical trials. Grade 3 or greater hypertension occurred in 5% of 
patients with a median time to onset of 5.9 months (range, 0.03 to 24 
months).</p>
              <p>Monitor blood pressure in patients treated with IMBRUVICA<sup>®</sup> and initiate or adjust anti-hypertensive medication throughout treatment with IMBRUVICA<sup>®</sup> as appropriate.</p>
              <p><strong>Second Primary Malignancies:</strong> Other malignancies (10%) including non-skin carcinomas (4%) have occurred in 1,124 patients treated with IMBRUVICA<sup>®</sup> in clinical trials. The most frequent second primary malignancy was non-melanoma skin cancer (6%).</p>
              <p><strong>Tumor Lysis Syndrome:</strong> Tumor lysis syndrome has been infrequently reported with IMBRUVICA<sup>®</sup> therapy. Assess the baseline risk (e.g., high tumor burden) and take appropriate precautions.</p>
              <p>Monitor patients closely and treat as appropriate.</p>
              <p><strong>Embryo-Fetal Toxicity:</strong> Based on findings in animals, IMBRUVICA<sup>®</sup> can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Advise women to avoid becoming pregnant while taking IMBRUVICA<sup>®</sup>
 and for 1 month after cessation of therapy. If this drug is used during
 pregnancy or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, 
the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to a fetus. 
Advise men to avoid fathering a child during the same time period.</p>
              <h2>ADVERSE REACTIONS</h2>
              <p>The most common adverse reactions (≥20%) in patients 
with B-cell malignancies (MCL, CLL/SLL, WM and MZL) were 
thrombocytopenia (58%)‡, diarrhea (41%), anemia (38%)‡, neutropenia 
(35%)‡, musculoskeletal pain (32%), rash (32%), bruising (31%), nausea 
(26%), fatigue (26%), hemorrhage (24%), and pyrexia (20%).</p>
              <p>The most common Grade 3 or 4 adverse reactions (≥5%) in
 patients with B-cell malignancies (MCL, CLL/SLL, WM and MZL) were 
neutropenia (18%)‡, thrombocytopenia (16%), and pneumonia (14%).</p>
              <p>Approximately 7% of patients discontinued IMBRUVICA<sup>®</sup>
 due to adverse reactions. Adverse reactions leading to discontinuation 
included pneumonia (1.1%), hemorrhage (1%), atrial fibrillation (0.9%), 
rash (0.7%), diarrhea (0.6%), neutropenia (0.5%), sepsis (0.4%), 
thrombocytopenia (0.4%), interstitial lung disease (0.3%), and bruising 
(0.2%). Nine percent of patients had a dose reduction due to adverse 
reactions.</p>
              <p class="small">‡Treatment-emergent decreases (all grades) were based on laboratory measurements.</p>
              <h2>DRUG INTERACTIONS</h2>
              <p><strong>CYP3A Inhibitors: </strong>Modify IMBRUVICA<sup>®</sup> dose as described in USPI sections 2.4 and 7.1.</p>
              <p><strong>CYP3A Inducers: </strong>Avoid coadministration with strong CYP3A inducers.</p>
              <h2>SPECIFIC POPULATIONS</h2>
              <p><strong>Hepatic Impairment</strong> (based on Child-Pugh criteria): Avoid use of IMBRUVICA<sup>®</sup> in patients with severe baseline hepatic impairment. In patients with mild or moderate impairment, reduce IMBRUVICA<sup>®</sup> dose.</p>
              <h2>INDICATIONS</h2>
              <p>IMBRUVICA<sup>®</sup> (ibrutinib) is a kinase inhibitor indicated for the treatment of adult patients with:</p>
